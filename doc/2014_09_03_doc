We worked individually to come up with ideas in relation to CD uses.  After a few minutes, we discussed what ideas we had come up with and then created one full list which was expanded upon once we saw each others ideas.  We have decided to implement this style of brain storming since we were able to create a large amount of quality ideas.

We have not formally discussed everyones role but we have agreed that Fallon is our team lead.

One of the unspoken norms that appears to have formed within our group is treating each other with respect.
We have agreed to aim for a 3/4 majority (3 of 4 people agree to one path) if there is a 50/50 tie then we will follow the decision of the team lead.

We appear to be in the forming stage.
